Known issues with version 2.0 of the Global Fishing Watch fishing effort dataset

The GFW algorithms attempt to classify and map the activity of hundreds of thousands of vessels using AIS data. AIS was not designed as a tool to track and monitor the activities of fishing fleets, and as a result there are a number of data challenges. Additionally, GFW informs its analyses with known information from vessel registries, which may be incorrect at times. As such, there are multiple known issues with the results of our global fishing effort dataset that stem from these and other challenges. This outlines and provides context to these issues. This outlines and provides context to these issues. If you see an issue with our dataset,  we welcome feedback via this Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEoT9zNiJF4tGgbI6cjdoPilHvD7uSz2JJeUIUpNNvhnWOKA/viewform?hl=en). For other descriptions of the known issues with AIS, we recommend referring to Kroodsma et al 2018 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/904.abstract; in particular, the supplementary materials) and Chapters 1-2 of the The Global Atlas of AIS-based Fishing Activity (https://globalfishingwatch.org/fisheries/fao-atlas/).

Identity spoofing: In theory, each Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number is meant to be unique to an individual AIS device, meaning AIS messages from a given MMSI should always correspond to the same vessel. However, MMSI numbers can be manually changed and, in practice, it is not uncommon to see the same MMSI number being used by two or more vessels simultaneously. GFW algorithms attempt to identify this behavior and exclude MMSI where identity spoofing is an issue. A few hundred fishing MMSI out of tens of thousands have this problem regularly, and most of these have been removed from our fishing effort data to avoid confusion. See this blog post for more information: Spoofing: One Identity Shared by Multiple Vessels (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/spoofing-one-identity-shared-by-multiple-vessels/)

Invalid MMSI numbers or MMSI’s corresponding to incorrect flag state: MMSI numbers are nine-digit numbers, with the first three digits usually a Maritime Identification Digits (MID). MIDs range from 201 to 775 and denote the administration (country) or geographical area of the administration responsible for the ship identified by the MMSI number. Some MMSI, such as those corresponding to helicopters, other aircraft, or navigational aids such as bouys can start with 0, 1, or 9. However, MMSI numbers can be manually changed and it is not uncommon to see MMSI numbers that either have too few digits or do not have the first three digits of their MMSI correctly correspond to a flag state. This presents two challenges. First, for vessels without registry information, the MID is the only indication of the vessel’s flag state and this information is missing from invalid MMSI numbers. The majority of these vessels fish exclusively in Chinese or Taiwanese waters, and GFW manually assigns them to these flag states accordingly. Second, if a vessel uses a valid MMSI but with an incorrect MID, the activity of that vessel will be attributed to an incorrect flag state. A known example of this latter issue is with the Albanian MID code (201), which is commonly known to be incorrectly used by vessels in Asia. GFW attempts to correct this issue with manual review (e.g. do MMSI appear to exclusively fish in a foreign EEZ that does not match their MID), but some errors persist.

Multigear vessels: At present, the GFW vessel classification model predicts a single vessel class for each MMSI based on the total activity of that MMSI in the AIS data. In reality, some fishing vessels have changed fishing gears over the time range of the dataset (2012-2020), while others may use multiple different fishing gears over the course of a single year. As a result, some fishing activity by these multigear vessels will not be attributed to the correct fishing gear.

AIS reception: For a number of reasons, not all AIS messages that are broadcast by a vessel are received by terrestrial and satellite receivers. AIS messages may overlap in time, especially in areas of high vessel density, and their signals can interfere (“collide”) with one another, preventing messages from being received by satellites. This issue does not affect terrestrial AIS receivers, however, because terrestrial receivers can receive messages only a few tens of miles from shore, and thus fewer messages can interfere with one another. Terrestrial receivers, though, are not evenly distributed along the world’s coastlines and an AIS device must be within a few tens of nautical miles of a terrestrial receiver for its messages to be received. Lastly, AIS devices vary in signal strength and broadcast messages at different rates depending on vessel speed and AIS device type (class A or B). Through a combination of these factors, the quantity and quality of AIS data is not homogenous around the world and it is not uncommon to observe transmission gaps in a vessel’s AIS signal that are many hours long.

False positives on fishing activity: The Global Fishing Watch fishing detection neural net model predicts whether individual AIS positions are fishing or non-fishing positions. When making predictions, this model considers a complex set of features related to a vessel’s movements, of which speed is the most important. In fact, the initial Global Fishing Watch fishing detection model was a simple speed filtering algorithm. Unfortunately, given the importance of speed to the detection of fishing activity, our fishing detection model is prone to false positive predictions during transits when a vessel is moving slow. For example, fishing vessels passing through canals or moving slowly near ports (e.g. Chinese vessels awaiting authorization to enter Peruvian ports) are problematic. The issue is particularly problematic for squid jigging vessels, which can remain relatively stationary when fishing. For this release, we have manually applied a filter that requires any vessel traveling in a straight line for more than 24 hours to not be fishing, which affects less than half a percent of our fishing activity. However, some false positives still appear.

Offsetting: Occasionally, the AIS messages transmitted from a ship provide a location that makes no sense, say, in the middle of the Antarctic or over a mountain range. In such cases, either the AIS transponder has malfunctioned, the data got scrambled in transmission, or the system has been tampered with in a deliberate attempt to disguise the vessel’s location. GFW identifies these offsetting vessels using our algorithms and manual review and removes them from the data in years where they’re identified as offsetting. We are working on methods to correct rather than exclude these bad tracks. For more information, see these blog posts: When Vessels Report False Locations (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/when-vessels-report-false-locations/); AIS ship tracking data shows false vessels tracks circling above Point Reyes, near San Francisco (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-blog/circling-above-point-reyes/)

Missing ~90% of Orbcomm data on October 1st 2015: In the current iteration of the GFW AIS dataset, there was an issue when ingesting data for October 1st, 2015 and  ~90% of AIS messages are missing on this date. As a result, data for this date includes approximately 50% of the MMSI active at the time and captures ~30% of activity. The loss of activity (hours) is not higher because the GFW algorithm assigns time to each AIS position based on the time since the previous position. Thus, only activity for vessels entirely absent from the data on this date is lost. For vessels included in the data, the time associated with the missing data points is simply attributed to the remaining positions.
