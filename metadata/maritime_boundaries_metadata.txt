Attribute table
The table below describes the semantics of each field in the EEZ dataset attribute table.
Attribute name
	Description
	MRGID
MRGID_EEZ
	Marine Regions Geographic Identifier of the polygon feature.
Unique, persistent and resolvable identifier used in the Marine Regions gazetteer.
	GEONAME
	Name of the polygon feature.
	POL_TYPE
	Type of polygon area.
Possible values: ‘200NM’, ‘Joint regime’, ‘Overlapping claim’.
	TERRITORY1
	Specific land area which directly relates to the polygon.
For example: for EEZs bordering a country, the territory is the country. For EEZs surrounding an island, the territory is the island itself (e.g. Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (Madeira)).
	MRGID_TER1
	MRGID for the territory
	ISO_TER1
	ISO3 code for the territory
	UN_TER1
	UN code (M49 Country code) for the territory
	SOVEREIGN1
	State that has jurisdiction over the territory.
For example: for Madeira this is Portugal.
	MRGID_SOV1
	MRGID for the sovereign
	ISO_SOV1
	ISO3 code for the sovereign
	UN_SOV1
	UN code (M49 Country code) for the sovereign
	TERRITORY2
SOVEREIGN2


TERRITORY3
SOVEREIGN3
	For joint regimes and overlapping claims, multiple states can claim a territory (and associated EEZ) or sea area. In this case, the different territories and their sovereign state are listed in the attribute table.


For disputed islands/rocks, the territories refer to the islands/rocks/land that are claimed, so in this case the attribute values for TERRITORY1 and TERRITORY2 (and TERRITORY3) will be identical.
For example (Overlapping claim Falkland / Malvinas Islands: UK / Argentina):


TERRITORY1
	TERRITORY2
	SOVEREIGN1
	SOVEREIGN2
	Falkland / Malvinas Islands
	Falkland / Malvinas Islands
	United Kingdom
	Argentina
	



For sea areas, the territories are the territories that claim the EEZ.
For example (Overlapping claim: Puerto Rico / Dominican Republic):


TERRITORY1
	TERRITORY2
	SOVEREIGN1
	SOVEREIGN2
	Puerto Rico
	Dominican Republic
	United States
	Dominican Republic
	



Exception: Overlapping claim South China Sea, as there are more than three states claiming this area, not all claiming parties are included in the attribute table.
	MRGID_TER2
MRGID_TER3
MRGID_SOV2
MRGID_SOV3


ISO_TER2
ISO_TER3
ISO_SOV2
ISO_SOV3


UN_TER2
UN_TER3
UN_SOV2
UN_SOV3
	Similar to MRGID_...1, ISO_...1 and UN_...1.
	AREA_KM2
	Area of polygon in square kilometers, calculated in PostGIS by casting the geometry to geography
	X_1
	Centroid longitude of polygon, calculated in PostGIS (EPSG:4326)
	Y_1
	Centroid latitude of polygon, calculated in PostGIS (EPSG:4326)
